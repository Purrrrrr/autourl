Code more, browse imgur less!

Situation: You want to lead a productive life and get something done
Problem: Your friends post numerous fun links to imgur that ultimately 
         lead you to just browse the internet instead of working
Solution: autourl!

Autourl is a small, but growing collection of scripts designed for opening URLs.
The scripts detect image URLs and open them in a image viewer instead of a browser
defaulting for a browser only in the case of non-image sites.

This script can be used to replace your default browser helping keep the browser
cache clean and your work less interrupted.
